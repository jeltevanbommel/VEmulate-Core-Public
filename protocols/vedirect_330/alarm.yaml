detailed_description: "This shows the buzzer alarm state of the BMV. During normal operation, this will be 'OFF'.
                       When a buzzer alarm occurs the value will change to 'ON'.
                       Note: This refers to the value of the alarm condition, and not the buzzer itself. This means
                       that once a condition has occurred, the value will be 'ON' until all alarm conditions have
                       cleared; regardless of whether or not a button has been pressed to silence the buzzer"
