detailed_description: "Relay alarm state of the BMV and the SmartSolar MPPT chargers. This shows the relay alarm state of the BMV and the SmartSolar MPPT chargers. During
                       normal operation, this will be 'OFF'. When a relay alarm occurs the value will change to
                       'ON'.
                       Note for both Alarm and Relay: BMV-600â€™s with firmware v2.09 or lower used to send 'On'
                       and 'Off' instead of 'On' and 'Off'. It is therefore recommended to use a case-insensitive
                       string comparison in your implementation, for example stricmp()."
