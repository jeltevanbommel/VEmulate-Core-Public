# VEmulator
VEmulator allows the emulation of devices that use the VE.Direct text and/or hex protocol. During the implementation 
of the emulator, the following naming convention has been agreed upon: a VE.Direct text/hex message can have one or more
_fields_ which have a certain _value_. How these values are generated is determined by the _scenarios_ defined for this field.

## Installing
To make sure all the required packages are installed before running the emulator, first run `pip install .`

## Running
To run the emulator two classes are needed. First, an instance of vemulator.configuration.config.EmulatorConfig needs to be created. 
This config instance can then be used to set up the emulator, including what it should use for inputting and outputting hex/text messages, for which classes 
can be found in vemulator.input and vemulator.output
Then, this config needs to be passed to an instance of vemulator.generator.emulator.Emulator which can then be started. An example of this can be seen below:

```python
from vemulator.configuration.config import EmulatorConfig
from vemulator.util import log
from vemulator.emulator.emulator import Emulator
from vemulator.input.serialinput import SerialInput
from vemulator.output.serialoutput import SerialOutput

# By default, errors and other info is logged to config files
# By setting this to true, errors will also be logged to stdout:
log.set_stdout_logging(True)

config = EmulatorConfig()  # Create a new emulator config
config.set_config_file('config.yaml')  # Set a config file
config.set_input(SerialInput('/dev/tty0'))  # Input from which to read hex messages
config.set_output(SerialOutput('/dev/tty0'))  # Output to which hex and text messages should be written
config.set_delay(1)  # Delay between text messages 
config.set_bit_error_rate(0.04)  # Bit error rate 
config.set_bit_error_checksum(True)  # Also add errors to the checksum
config.set_default_seed(10)  # Seed to use by default for RNG
config.create_scenarios()  # Create generators based on the fields in the config file

emulator = Emulator(config)  # Create the emulator using the config
emulator.run()  # Start the emulator

# Other useful functions:
emulator.pause()  # Pause the emulator
emulator.resume()  # Resume the emulator
emulator.stop()  # Stop the emulator
emulator.get_status()  # Get the status of the emulator
emulator.overwrite_text_scenarios('key', [])  # Overwrite the scenarios of a text field that are used for value generation
emulator.overwrite_hex_scenarios('key', [])  # Overwrite the scenarios of a hex field that are used for value generation
```

## Unit tests
To run the unit tests, run `python3 test.py`. If this prints `OK` at the end, all unit tests have completed successfully.
If the unit tests take more than about a second there is probably an infinite loop somewhere in the code where it should not be.

```

## Configuration
When running the emulator, a configuration should be added. Some example configurations can be found in `/configs`. 
These configs are written in yaml. When the emulator is run, the config file will first be checked for errors and if 
the config is invalid, an error will be written to the error log describing what is wrong.  
When defining fields in a config, one can include predefined fields by using them as so-called presets. 
These preset fields can be found in `/protocols`, where the name of the directory inside `/protocols` is the name of the 
preset, and the name of the yaml files inside those directories (excluding the extension) is the name of the field to include.

Fields can have values of all kinds of types. Some of these types can be found in the presets in the `/protocols` directory. 
Apart from this, the all so-called scenario types can be found in the `/vemulator/scenarios` directory. In these source files,
a usage example is given for each of these scenarios. A list overview of the scenarios, and their purpose, can be found below: 

- `Arithmetic` Calculate a value based on the value of one or more other fields
- `Gradient` Generate values based on a mathematical function of time
- `IntBoundary` Generates numbers within a certain boundary
- `IntChoice` Chooses values from a list of integers
- `IntFixed` A fixed integer value
- `IntRandom` Generates a random integer value
- `IntRange` Generates numbers within a certain range
- `Regex` Generates strings that match a regex
- `Mapping` Similar to choice scenarios but a description of the values can also be provided
- `StringFixed` A fixed string value
- `SelectRandom` Randomly selects one of its child scenarios
- `StringBoundary` Generates strings within a certain length boundary
- `StringChoice` Chooses values from a list of strings
- `StringRandom` Generates a random string value
- `StringUnicode` Generates a random string value that can contain all unicode characters (not necessarily ascii characters)

An example of the structure of a config file can be found here:
